        <h3>Renee's Baking Journey</h3>
        <p>Renee grew up on her grandmother's pound cake, which made appearances at every family holiday. Once, she
          decided
          to make her own pound cake, with a recipe of her own. As a twelve-year-old, she had no idea that "pound cake"
          meant a pound of each ingredient. Thus, her poor cake came out of the oven swimming in her favorite
          ingredient:
          butter. Since then, Renee has dramatically improved her baking abilities (despite still being a little afraid
          of
          cakes), and hopes to share her recipes on Just Dough It.</p>
